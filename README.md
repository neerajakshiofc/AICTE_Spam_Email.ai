# 📧 AICTE\_Spam\_Email.ai

**AICTE\_Spam\_Email.ai** is a machine learning project designed to **detect and filter spam emails** related to AICTE notifications or educational communications. It leverages **NLP (Natural Language Processing)** and **ML algorithms** to classify emails as spam or legitimate.

---

## 🚀 Features

* **Spam Detection** 🚫 – Identifies unsolicited or spammy emails automatically.
* **Email Classification** 📧 – Classifies emails into spam or legitimate categories using ML models.
* **NLP-based Analysis** 📝 – Processes email text to extract meaningful features for prediction.
* **Accuracy & Reliability** ✅ – Uses trained models to minimize false positives and negatives.

---

## 🛠 Technology Stack

* **Programming Language**: Python
* **Libraries & Frameworks**:

  * **scikit-learn** – Machine learning algorithms
  * **pandas & numpy** – Data processing
  * **NLTK / spaCy** – Natural language processing
* **Data Storage**: CSV / Dataset files
* **Model**: ML models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Decision Trees

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. **Data Collection** – Gathered emails from AICTE and other educational sources.
2. **Preprocessing** – Cleaned text, removed stopwords, and tokenized emails.
3. **Feature Extraction** – Converted text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF or CountVectorizer.
4. **Model Training** – Trained ML models to classify emails as spam or legitimate.
5. **Prediction** – Input new email text to predict spam likelihood.
